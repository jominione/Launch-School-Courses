// What does the last line in the following code output?

let object = { first: [1] };
let numArray = object["first"];
numArray.push(2);

console.log(numArray); //  => "[1, 2]"
console.log(object);

// Solution: Will output { first: [1, 2] } because numArray is points to a 
// reference type whose value is shared with object['first']. When reference 
// types are mutated, the values in all the variables that point to that
// will change.
