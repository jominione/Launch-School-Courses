// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until 
// you have tried to answer.

let myWord = 'Hello';
myWord.repeat(3);
console.log(myWord);
myWord.replace('H', 'J');
console.log(myWord);
myWord.toUpperCase();
console.log(myWord);

// Solution: Each of the console.log() invocations logs the original value
// 'Hello'. This is the same string in each case, and it isn't affected by
// any of the intervening method invocations (repeat, replace, and 
// toUpperCase), each of which return a new string but don't have any effect
// on the original string, which is immutable. It doesn't matter which String
// methods we call on the string, or in which order. Strings, being primitive
// values, are immutable.
