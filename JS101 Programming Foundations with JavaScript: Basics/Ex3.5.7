// What is the output of the following code?

let answer = 42;

function messWithIt(someNumber) {
  return (someNumber += 8);
}

let newAnswer = messWithIt(answer);

console.log(answer - 8);

// Solution: Will output 34. The variable answer is assigned a number which
// is a primitive value and therefore immutable. When functiion messWithIt
// is passed answer variable as argument it acts like pass-by-value. That
// it copy number value assigns it to the parameter initialised by messWithIt.
// Hence there is no effect on answer.
