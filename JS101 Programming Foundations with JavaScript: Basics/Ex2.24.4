// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until 
// you have tried to answer.

let myWords = ['Hello', 'Goodbye'];
let myOtherWords = myWords;
myWords = ['Hi', 'Bye'];

console.log(myWords);
console.log(myOtherWords);

// Solution: Will output ['Hi', 'Bye'] and ['Hello', 'Goodbye']. Variable
// myOtherWords is assigned the value of myWords. Both variables point to same
// reference in memory that hold the array.
// When myWords is reassigned a different array, it stores the references to
// memory that points to array value but this has no effect on myOtherWords
// which point to original array.

// Both variables have as their value the memory address where the array is
// stored. The variable myWords is reassigned to a different value. In this
// case we're reassigning it to another array, but we could equally have
// reassigned it to a primitive value. The important point is that the variable
// now points to a different value and so the two variables no longer have
// the same value (the memory address where the ['Hello', 'Goodbye'] array
// is stored). When we log each variable, different values are therefore 
// output.
