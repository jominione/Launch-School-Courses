// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until
// you have tried to answer.

let num = 5;

function myFunc() {
  let num = 10;
}

myFunc();
console.log(num);

// Solution: Will output 5. The num declared within function myFunc is not
// visible outside of its local scope. When last line of code is executed
// it logs the value of num which is still 5.

// The variable initialised in myFunc is a new variable rather than the 
// reassignment of the variable on line 1.
