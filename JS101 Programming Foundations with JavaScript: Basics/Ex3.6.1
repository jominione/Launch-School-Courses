// Will the following functions return the same results?

function first() {
  return {
    prop1: "hi there",
  };
}

function second() {
  return
  {
    prop1: "hi there";
  }
}

console.log(first());
console.log(second());

// Solution: They will not return same result. Will output {prop1: "hi there"}
// and undefined.

// In JavaScript, semicolons are technically optional but when you omit them,
// the JavaScript engine inserts them where it thinks you need them. In second
// function, JavaScript inserts a semicolon after the word return, so the
// function returns undefined. No errors are thrown since the rest of the
// code is valid, even though it never gets executed.
