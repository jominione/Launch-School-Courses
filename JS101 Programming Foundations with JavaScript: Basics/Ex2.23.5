// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until 
// you have tried to answer.

let myWords = ['Hello'];
myWords[0].toUpperCase();

console.log(myWords);

// Solution: Will output ['Hello']. Elements of an array can be mutated or 
// reassigned with a new value but the .toUpperCase method creates a new string
// but not assigned to any variable. Hence the myWords array is not mutated
// and console.log logs original value.

// We're calling the toUpperCase() methon on the string at index 0 of the
// array. Being primitive types, strings are immutable, so the method has 
// no effect on the string (it instead returns a new string), and we're not
// mutating the array or changing the value at index 0.
