// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until
// you have tried to answer.

let num = 1;

while (num < 3) {
  let num = 5;
  num += 1;
}

console.log(num);

// [Wrong] Solution: Will output 1. Within the while loop a new variable num is 
// declared and initialised. This variable is visible only within the block.
// So when the code completes the while loop, the parameter num refers to the
// global variable which still has value 1.

// This doesn't log anything to the console. This code results in an infinite
// loop, which will eventually time out. Line 4 declares and initialises a 
// variable num to the number 5. This is a different variable to the num
// declared and initialised to 1 on line 1, and exists within the scope of the
// block defined by the curly braces; it is this num that is incremented on
// line 5. The condition for the while loop, however, references the num
// declared on line 1, not the one within the scope of the block. The condition
// for ending the while loop is therefore never met, resulting in an infinite
// loop.
