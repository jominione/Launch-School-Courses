// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until 
// you have tried to answer.

let myWords = ['Hello'];
myWords[0] = myWords[0].toUpperCase();

console.log(myWords);

// Solution: Will output ['HELLO']. Calling .toUpperCase() method on element at
// index 0 returns a new string 'HELLO' and reassign it to index 0 of the
// array. So variable myWords has mutated and will output ['HELLO'].

// This logs [ 'HELLO' ] to the console. Unlike the previous example, here 
// we are mutating the array by changing the value at index 0. It's important 
// to note that we aren't mutating the original string, but instead setting 
// the value at index 0 to a new string returned by calling 
// String.prototype.toUpperCase on the original string.
