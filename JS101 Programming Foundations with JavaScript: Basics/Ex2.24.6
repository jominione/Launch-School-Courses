// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until 
// you have tried to answer.

let myWords = ['Hello', 'Goodbye'];
let myWord = 'Hi';
myWords[0] = myWord;
myWord = 'Hello';

console.log(myWords);
console.log(myWord);

// Solution: Will output ['Hi', 'Goodbye'] and 'Hello'. The element at index 0
// of the array referenced by myWords is reassigned to a new value, the string
// stored referenced by variable myWord. Because string is a primitive type,
// index 0 of the array referenced by myWords and the myWord variable each
// reference different strings at different memory addresses, even though those
// strings have the same value. We then reassign myWord with new value, the
// string 'Hello'. This has no impact on myWords because elements within the
// array myWords references point to different memory addresses.

// The values we are dealing with are primitives, and the value of these 
// primitive values are stored at different memory addresses. Changing the 
// value of one does not affect the other.
