// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until
// you have tried to answer.

let num = 5;

function myFunc() {
  console.log(num);
  num = 10;
}

myFunc();
console.log(num);

// Solution: Will output 5 and then 10. Like the previous exercise num declared
// and initialised with value 5 is visible and accessible within scope of the
// myFunc function. When myFunc is invoked the log method outputs the parameter 
// num which has value 5. It is then reassigned to value 10.
