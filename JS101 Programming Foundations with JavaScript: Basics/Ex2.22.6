// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until
// you have tried to answer.

let num = 1;

while (num < 3) {
  num += 1;
}

console.log(num);

// Solution: Will output 3. The variable num is initialised with value 1 but
// when while loop is triggered increments num by 1 each loop before the while
// loop no longer runs. The program than logs the num value which is now 3.
