// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until
// you have tried to answer.

let num = 5;

function myFunc() {
  console.log(num);
  let num = 10;
}

myFunc();
console.log(num);

// Solution: Will raise a ReferenceError that num not initialised. The new 
// variable declared in myFunc is initialised after it is already being called. 
// When num is called within myFunc it is looking for num within its local 
// scope. Since num is not initialised when it is executed will raise an error.
