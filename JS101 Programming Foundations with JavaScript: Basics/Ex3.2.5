// What will the following code output?

console.log(false == '0');
console.log(false === '0');

// Solution: Will output true and false.

// In JavaScript, there are two equality operators: strict equality (===)
// and non-strict (or weak) equality (==). The === operator behaves as a
// traditional equality oeprator does in most languages: it evalutes as true
// when two expressions on either side have the same type and value. On the
// other hand, the == operator coerces the values to the same type before
// comparing them. Coercisions can produce unexpected and confusing behaviour.
// Thus, it's good practice to use === rather than ==. The same holds for the 
// !== vs. != operators: prefer !==.
