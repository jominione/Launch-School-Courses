// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until

let myWord = 'Hello';
myWord.concat(' there.');

console.log(myWord);

// Solution: Output 'Hello'. The concat method concats myWord and ' there. '
// string and returns new object, not mutate myWord. Therefore myWord has not
// been mutated and logs original value 'Hello'.

// The myWord variable is assigned to a string, which as a primitive is 
// immutable. Calling concat on the string returns a new string with the
// string there. appended to it. This doesn't affect the original string and
// we don't do anything with the return value.
