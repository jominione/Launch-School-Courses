// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until
// you have tried to answer.

let num = 5;

function myFunc() {
  num = 10;
}

myFunc();
console.log(num);

// Solution: Will output 10. When myFunc is invoked num is reassigned to value
// 10.

// The variable num declared and initialised to 5 is accessible within the
// scope of the myFunc function.
