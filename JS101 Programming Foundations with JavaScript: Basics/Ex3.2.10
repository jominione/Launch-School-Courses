// Return a new version of this sentence that ends just before the word house. 
// Don't worry about spaces or punctuation: remove everything starting from 
// the beginning of house to the end of the sentence.

let advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your " + 
             "pet dinosaur.";

// Expected return value:
// => 'Few things in life are as important as '

// Hint: Review the String.prototype.slice() and String.prototype.indexOf() 
// methods on MDN, and use those methods to create the return value.

// Solution:

console.log(advice.slice(0, advice.indexOf('house')));
