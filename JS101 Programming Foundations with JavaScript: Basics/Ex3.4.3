// What will the following code output?

let str1 = "hello there";
let str2 = str1;
str2 = "goodbye!";
console.log(str1);

// Solution: Will output 'hello there'. The program initiates str1 with string
// and initiates str2 by assigning it str1. Since string are primitive type
// the two variables point to different strings even though they are the same
// value. So when str2 is reassigned string value 'goodbye!' this has no
// effect on the value of str1. When you console.log str1 it will output 
// 'hello there'.

// In JavaScript, strings are primitive values and are immutable; they can't
// be changed. That means that JavaScript creates a new copy of the string
// when assigning a string to a variable.
