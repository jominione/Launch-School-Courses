// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until 
// you have tried to answer.

let myWords = ['Hello', 'Goodbye'];
let myWord = myWords[0];
myWords[0] = 'Hi';

console.log(myWords);
console.log(myWord);

// Solution: Will output ['Hi', 'Goodbye'] and 'Hello'. Variable myWord is
// initialised with primitive type, not reference type. Primitive types are
// stored in memory where the variable points to. The array which myWords 
// points to then is mutated at index 0 and reassigned with string value 'Hi'.
// The program therefore logs ['Hi', 'Goodbye'] and 'Hello'.

// We declare and initialize another variable, myWord, to the element at index 
// 0 of the array referenced by myWords, which is the string 'Hello'. Because 
// that string is a primitive type, index 0 of the array and the myWord 
// variable each reference different strings at different memory addresses, 
// even though those strings have the same value.

// We then reassign index 0 of the myWords array to a new value, the string 
// 'Hi'. This changes the value stored at index 0 of the array, but has no 
// effect on the value stored by the myWord variable.
