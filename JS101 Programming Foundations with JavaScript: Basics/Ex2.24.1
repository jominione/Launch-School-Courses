// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until 
// you have tried to answer.

let myWord = 'Hello';
let myOtherWord = myWord;

console.log(myWord);
console.log(myOtherWord);

// Solution: Output 'Hello' and 'Hello'. Variables with primitive values are
// stored at the memory location associated with the variable. So when 
// myOtherWord is initialised to the value of myWord, myOtherWord stores the value
// 'Hello'. So both output 'Hello'.

// Both variables point to a string with the value of 'Hello'. Even though 
// the strings have the same value they are different strings stored at 
// different memory addresses.
