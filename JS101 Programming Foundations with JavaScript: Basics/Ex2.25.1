// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until 
// you have tried to answer.

function changeMyWord(word) {
  console.log(word);
  word = word.toUpperCase();
}

let myWord = 'Hello';
changeMyWord(myWord);
console.log(myWord);

// Solution: Will output 'Hello' and 'Hello'. The variable myWord is a 
// primitive value so can't be mutated. When passed to the changeMyWord 
// function log the string value 'Hello'. The program then invokes console.log
// calling myWord which logs the value 'Hello'.

// Because we are dealing with a primitive value, the myWord variable and
// the word function parameter point to different places in memory.

// Essentially, passing in myWord as an argument to the changeMyWord function
// invocation acts like pass-by-value. Because of this, nothing we do with
// the word parameter in the function, such as calling toUpperCase() on it
// and re-assiging word, will have any effect on the value of the myWord
// variable. Therefore, when we log the value of myWord, 'Hello' is the output.
