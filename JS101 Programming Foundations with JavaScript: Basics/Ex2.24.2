// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until 
// you have tried to answer.

let myWord = 'Hello';
let myOtherWord = myWord;
myWord = 'Goodbye';

console.log(myWord);
console.log(myOtherWord);

// Solution: Will output 'Goodbye' and 'Hello'. Variables with primitives store
// the value at the same place as the variable. So when myOtherWord is 
// initialised with the value of myWord, it points to the string 'Hello'.
// Both strings have the value 'Hello' but are different strings.
// When myWord is reassigned with value 'Goodbye' this has no effect on the
// valued stored at myOtherWord.

// Both variables are pointing to a string with the value of 'Hello', but
// these strings exist at different addresses in memory. By reassigning the
// myWord variable, we are changing what is stored at the memory address myWord
// points to.
