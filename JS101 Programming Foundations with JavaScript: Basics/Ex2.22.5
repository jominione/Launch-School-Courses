// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until
// you have tried to answer.

let num = 5;

function myFunc(num) {
  num = 10;
}

myFunc();
console.log(num);

// Solution: Will output 5. The function myFunc initialises a parameter 
// variable num that shadows the global variable num. When myFunc is invoked
// without an argument, JavaScript default assigns num as undefined.

// When the myFunc function is invoked, due to the function parameter num
// JavaScript creates a new variable num within the scope of the function. This
// variable blocks access to the variable of the same name declared and 
// initialised in the global scope. That variable cannot therefore be 
// reassigned by the function and so retains its initial value of 5, which
// is what is logged.
