// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until 
// you have tried to answer.

let myWords = ['Hello'];
myWords.concat(['Goodbye']);

console.log(myWords);

// Solution: Will output ['Hello'].

// Although myWords is assigned to an array, which is an object and therefore
// mutable, the Array.concat method doesn't mutate the array it is called on;
// instead returns a new array. Just because objects are mutable, we shouldn't
// assume that all methods called on an object will mutate it.
