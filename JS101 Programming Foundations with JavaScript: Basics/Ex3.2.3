// Determine whether the following object of people and their age contains 
// an entry for 'Spot':

let ages = { Herman: 32, Lily: 30, Grandpa: 402, Eddie: 10 };

// Note that our keys have capitalized names; this usually violates style 
// guidelines, but is fine for our purposes. We'll use such keys in several 
// exercises in this course.

// Hint: Read about the Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty() method on MDN.

// Solution:

console.log(ages.hasOwnProperty('Spot'))
