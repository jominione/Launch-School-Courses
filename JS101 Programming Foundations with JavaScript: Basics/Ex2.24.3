// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until 
// you have tried to answer.

let myWords = ['Hello', 'Goodbye'];
let myOtherWords = myWords;
myWords[0] = 'Hi';

console.log(myWords);
console.log(myOtherWords);

// Solution: Output ['Hi', 'Goodbye'] twice. Variables point to objects in
// memory. When myOtherWords was initialised with the value of myWords it
// points to array with the same value but stored at different memory
// locations. The elements of the array are primitive values and point to
// same memory location. So when myWords indexed at 0 is reassigned string 
// value 'Hi' it mutates the array object stored at both myWords and 
// myOtherWords.

// Variable myWords is initialised to an array, which is a reference type.
// With reference types, the value stored in memory that the variable points
// to is a reference to another location in memory. Both variables have as
// their value the memory address where the array is stored.

// We're not reassigning the myWords variable, instead we're changing the
// value of one of the array elements that the myWords variable references.

// Because we've changed, or mutated, the array, and because both variables
// references the same array, when we log both variables we get the same 
// output.
