// Will the code below raise an error?

let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers[6] = 5;

// Solution: No. Arrays are objects, so when you access numbers with index 6
// and assign value 5, you are mutatin numbers array by appending a new element
// with key of 'index 6' and value 5.



// Bonus:

let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers[6] = 5;
numbers[4];  // what will this line return?

// Solution to Bonus: Will raise a RangeError because numbers array does not
// have an element at index 4.
