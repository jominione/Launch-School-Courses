// Consider the following class declaration:

class Television {
  static manufacturer() {
    // omitted code
  }

  model() {
    // method logic
  }
}

// What does the `static` modifier do? How would we call the method `manufacturer`?

// Solution: The `static` keyword allow for static methods. Static methods
// defined on the class rather than instance objects. They are not available
// from class instances.

// You can call the `manufacturer` method by the following:

Television.manufacturer();
