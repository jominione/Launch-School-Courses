// Which of the following statements about hoisting are correct? Choose all
// of the answers that apply.

// A - Hoisting physically rearranges your program to move your function
//     declarations to the top of their scope; you can see the hoisted code
//     in Node.
// B - Hoisting occurs in most programming languages, but not in JavaScript.
// C - JavaScript runs programs in two passes; the first pass performs hoisting
//     other preliminary actions, and the second executes the code.
// D - Hoisting involves scanning a program for all function definitions before
//     JavaScript executes the code. It lets your program invoke functions
//     before it encounters them during the execution phase.
