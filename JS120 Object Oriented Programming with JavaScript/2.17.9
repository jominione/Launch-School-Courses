// Assume that each of the following programs is stored in a file that you

// run it with the command `node code_x.js`.

// Which of these programs won't throw an error when you run them? Select

// A:

console.log(sum(3, 4));

const sum = function(number1, number2) {
  let total = number1 + number2;
  return total;
};

// B:

console.log(sum(3, 4));

function sum(number1, number2) {
  return number1 + number2;
}

// C:

console.log(sum(3, 4));

const sum = (number1, number2) => number1 + number2;

// D:

(function sum(number1, number2) {
  return number1 + number2;
});

console.log(sum(3, 4));
