/*
In the last question, we used a mix-in named `Speed` that contained a `goFast`
method. We included the mix-in in the `Car` class and then called the `goFast`
method from an instance of the `Car` class. You may have noticed that the
string pritned when we call `goFast` includes the name of the type of vehicle
we are using. How is that done?

Hint:

Since the `constructor` property references a function object,
`constructor.name` references the `name` property on that object. Use MDN
to lookup the definition of `Function.name`.
