// Examine the following code.

let arr1 = new Array(1, 2, 3);
let arr2 = Array(1, 2, 3);

console.log(arr1 === arr2); // => false

// While line 6 shows that the two arrays are different objects, it doesn't
// reveal whether the two arrays differ in any other way, i.e., in their type,
// content, or behaviour. Do the arrays differ in any way other than being
// separate objects?

// A - Yes.
// B - No.
// C - Indeterminate.
