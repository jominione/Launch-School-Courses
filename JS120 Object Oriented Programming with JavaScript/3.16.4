// Which of the following statements about instance and static methods are
// true? Choose all that apply.

// A - Instance methods are stored either as part of an object or somewhere
//     in the object's prototype chain.
// B - Instance methods and static methods are synonmous -- they're two ways
//     to describe the same concept.
// C - Static methods are methods that apply to the constructor or class itself,
//     not a specific object created by that constructor or class.
// D - Instance methods are methods that are available for access from outside
//     the scope of the constructor or class. Static methods must be accessed
//     from within the constructor or class.
