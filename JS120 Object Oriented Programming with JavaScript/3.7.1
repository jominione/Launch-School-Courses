// Suppose we want to use code to keep track of products in our hardware
// store's inventory. A first stab might look something like this:

let scissorsId = 0;
let scissorsName = 'Scissors';
let scissorsStock = 8;
let scissorsPrice = 10;

let drillId = 1;
let drillName = 'Cordless Drill';
let drillStock = 15;
let drillPrice = 45;

// This code presents a number of problems, however. What if we want to add
// another kind of drill? Given what we've learned about object orientation
// in the previous assignment, how could we use objects to organise these
// two groups of data?

// Solution:
