// Let's add a method, `readBook`, that marks a book objects as read by setting
// the `read` property to `true`.

// Solution:

function createBook(title, author, read=false) {
  return {
    title,
    author,
    getDescription () {
      return `${this.title} was written by ${this.author}.`;
    },
    read,
    readBook () {
      this.read = true;
    }
  };
}

let book1 = createBook('Mythos', 'Stephen Fry');

console.log(book1.read);
book1.readBook();
console.log(book1.read);
