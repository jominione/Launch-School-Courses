// Finally, let's update `getDescription` function to reflect the `read` state
// directly, for instance:

let book1 = createBook('Mythos', 'Stephen Fry');
console.log(book1.getDescription());  // Mythos was written by David Fry. I haven't read it.
book1.readBook();
console.log(book1.getDescription());  // Mythos was written by David Fry. I have read it.

// Solution:

function createBook(title, author, read=false) {
  return {
    title,
    author,
    getDescription () {
      return `${this.title} was written by ${this.author}. ` + 
             `I ${this.read ? "have" : "haven't"} read it.`;
    },
    read,
    readBook () {
     this.read = true;
    }
  };
}
