// Which of the following are benefits of using OOP? Select all that apply.

// A - Large, complex programs can be difficult to maintain due to dependencies
//     throughout the program. OOP lets programmers write programs in a manner
//     that reduces dependencies and makes maintenance easier.
// B - OOP lets programmers write more efficient programs that consume less
//     memory, less disk space, and less computing power.
// C - Complex coding problems are often difficult to break down and solve
//     clearly and systematically. Using OOP to model objects and using 
//     real-world nouns to represent objects lets programmers think at a higher
//     level of abstraction. That, in turn, helps them break down and solve
//     problems.
// D - Large programs involve writing a great deal of code. Using OOP let
//     programmers write shorter programs than the equivalent procedural code.
