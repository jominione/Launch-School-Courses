// In this problem, we'll ask you to create a new instance of an object,
// without having direct access to the constructor function:

/*
let ninjaA;

{
  const Ninja = function() {
    this.swung = false;
  };

  ninjaA = new Ninja();
}

// create a `ninjaB` object here; don't change anything else

ninjaA.constructor === ninjaB.constructor   // => true
*/

// Hint:

/*
The value assigned to `ninjaA` is an object created by a constructor function.
As such, this object inherits a `constructor` property from its prototype
`Ninja.prototype`, which points back to its constructor. Think of a way to
use this poperty; that should help lead you to a solution.
