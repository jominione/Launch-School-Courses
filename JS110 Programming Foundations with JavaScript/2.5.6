// One of the most frequently used real-world string operations is that of
// 'string substitution", where we take a hard-coded string and modify it
// with various parameters from our program.

// Given this previously seen family object, print the name, age, and gender
// of each family member:

let munsters = {
  Herman: { age: 32, gender: 'male' },
  Lily: { age: 30, gender: 'female' },
  Grandpa: { age: 402, gender: 'male' },
  Eddie: { age: 10, gender: 'male' },
  Marilyn: { age: 23, gender: 'female' },
};

// Each output line should follow this pattern:

// (Name) is a (age)-year-old (male or female).

let members = Object.entries(munsters);

members.forEach( member => console.log(`${member[0]} is a ${member[1].age}-year-old ${member[1].gender}.`));
