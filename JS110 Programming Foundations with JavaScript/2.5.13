// Similar to the preivous question, you need to create a deep copy of the
// following nested object.

const truthiness = {
  falsy: [ null, undefined, '', false, NaN, 0],

// Hint: You can't leverage the JSON methods because JSON doesn't recognise
// undefined as a valid JSON value, so it converts it to null. It also treats
// NaN as null.

// You'll need to create a new object yourself, as well as copies of the nested
// arrays to assign to its properties.
