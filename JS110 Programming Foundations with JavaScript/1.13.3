// The following code differs slightly from the above code. What is the return
// value of map in this case? Why?

let result = [1, 2, 3].map(num => num * num);
console.log(result);

// Solution: Will return [1, 4, 9]. The callback function is written as a
// single expression so the curly braces and return statement are omitted
// and implicit return will be num * num.

// Without braces surrounding the body of the arrow function, JavaScript uses
// the computed value as the return value. In this case, the callback returns
// 1, 4, and 9 on the 3 iterations.
