// How does Array.prototype.fill work? Is it destructive? How can we find
// out?

let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(arr.fill(1, 1, 5));

// Solution: The .fill method takes a value and two indices and replaces the
// indices value in betwen those two given indices with the given value. It
// is also a destructive method.
