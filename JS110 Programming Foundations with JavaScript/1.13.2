// What is the return value of map in the following code? Why?

let result = [1, 2, 3].map(num => {
               num * num;
             });

console.log(result);

// Solution: [undefined, undefined, undefined]. map looks at the return value
// of the callback function to decide the elements in the returned array.
// Each element in the original array is replaced by what the callback returns
// for that element. In this case, there's no explicit return statement in
// the callback function, which means that the callback returns undefined
// each time.
