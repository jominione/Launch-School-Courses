// Identify the higher-order functions and callbacks in this code.

function scream(message, helper) {
  const shout = () => message.toUpperCase();

  return helper(shout());
}

const exclamate = str => str + "!!!";

const foo = ["help", "Boo", "arGH", "Oh no"];
const FOO = foo.map(word => scream(word, exclamate));

// Solution:

// Higher-order functions are functions that take another function as an
// argument, return a function, or do both.

// In this code, scream and map are higher-order functions since they both
// receive a callback function as an argument.

// Higher-order functions: scream, map.

// Callback functions are passed as arguments to other functions.

// In this code, the callback functions are exclamate, and the arrow function 
// passed into map, word => scream(word, exclamate).

// Callbacks: exclamate and arrow function: word => scream(word, exclamate).

// Note that shout is not used as a callback in this code. What is passed
// into helper, is the return value of shout, not the function itself.
