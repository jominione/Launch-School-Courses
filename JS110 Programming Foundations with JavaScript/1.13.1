// What is the return value of the filter method call below? Why?

console.log([1, 2, 3].filter(num => 'hi'));

// Solution: The return value is [1, 2, 3]. filter performs selection based
// on the truthiness of the callback's return value. In this case, the return
// value is always 'hi', which is truthy. Therefore filter will return a new
// array containing all of the elements in the original array.
