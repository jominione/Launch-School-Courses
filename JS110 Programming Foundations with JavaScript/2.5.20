// A UUID is a type of identifier often used to uniquely identify items, even
// when some of those items were created on a different server or by a 
// different application. That is, without any synchronisation, two or more
// computer systems can create new items and label them with a UUID with no
// significant risk of stepping on each other's toes. It accomplishes this
// feat through massive randomisation. The number of possible UUID values
// is approximately 3.4 X 10E38, which is a huge number. The chance of a
// conflict is vanishingly small with such a large number of possible values.

// Each UUID consists of 32 hexadecimal characters (the digits 0 - 9 and the 
// letters a - f) represented as a string. The value is typically broken into
// 5 sections in an 8-4-4-4-12 pattern, e.g., 
// 'f65c576-a6aa-17a8-faa1-a67f2dc9fa91'.

// Write a function that takes no arguments and returns a string that contains
// a UUID.

// Solution:

function generateUUID() {
  let characters = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'];
  let sections = [8, 4, 4, 4, 12];
  let strings = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < sections.length; i++) {
    let string = '';
    for (let j = 0; j < sections[i]; j++) {
      let randIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * characters.length)
      string += characters[randIndex].toString();
    }
    strings.push(string);
  }
  return strings.join('-');
}

console.log(generateUUID());
