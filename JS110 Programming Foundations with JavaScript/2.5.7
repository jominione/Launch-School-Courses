// Given the following code, what will the final values of a and b be? Try
// to answer without running the code.

let a = 2;
let b = [5, 8];
let arr = [a, b];

arr[0] += 2;
arr[1][0] -= a;

// Solution: a = 2 , b = [3, 8] and arr = [4, [3, 8]].

// Discussion: The value of a didn't change since we don't reference a at
// any point. The code arr[0] += 2 modifies the array arr, but not a. In
// effect, we are assignign a new value to that index of the array so that
// instead of arr[0] containing 2, the value obtained from a, it now contains
// 4.

// Since b is an array and we are modifying that array by assinging a new
// value to index 0, the value of b does change.
